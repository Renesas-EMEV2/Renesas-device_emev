 Bootable SD-Card

---------------------------------------------------

This is how to set up an SD-Card that can be used to boot Android for testing, without disrupting the internal NAND installation.

1) Prepare a FAT-formatted SD-Card, not larger than 2Gb
2) Copy there all the files from this project
3) Copy a file "fs.tar.gz" with a tar.gz of the complete Android file system 
4) Copy a file "uImage4" with the kernel image
5) Put the SD-Card in the renesas tablet and start it with Volume+ & Power, as if you were updating firmware
