If you want to make SGX kernel *.ko (no SMP version), the following procedure is a MUST.

NOTE - Before making these *.ko, Android Userland should be built first.

1) setup environment variables (see also ./env.sh)

$ export LANG=C
$ export ARCH=arm
$ export KERNELDIR=/path/to/linux-kernel/dir
$ export ANDROID_ROOT=/path/to/android
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-
$ export KERNEL_CROSS_COMPILE=$CROSS_COMPILE

2) compile

$ cd eurasia_km/eurasiacon/build/linux2/emev_android/
$ make

3) Check the result:

Under "eurasia_km/eurasiacon/binary2_emev_android_release/target" directory, you should see these files:

 bc_example.ko
 emxxlfb.ko
 pvrsrvkm.ko

You can find these also under this dir:

 $AOSP/out/target/product/emev/target/kbuild
